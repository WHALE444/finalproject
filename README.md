# finalproject
this is a solar system simulator
It's used for teaching kids about astronomy knowledge
When entering the first page, click the button
and then you can choose your vision
the first vision is an image that shows the order of 8 planets
tap each planet to see information about this planet
there's button on the bottom of the page "quiz"
click it to do a small quiz, it may be multiple choices or judgement
if you click the wrong options, the toast may be "seriously?""think clearly!"
if you are right it might reminds you "clever!""Excellent"
the second view is used for helping kids to remember planet's shape and name
the third button is entering the unity 3D model
you can slide the screen to spin your vision, and click the button to go forward or go back
the avd may not operate the models good (frames may overlap) so I upload my unity project with the program
the unity project named "unityproject.zip"
have fun!
